# Self-made-Arduino-Nano-Minimized-System
For learning microcontroller minimized system, drawn this minimum system board of Arduino Nano.

Developed with Arduino IDE, used another Arduino Uno as a burner, and used ICSP to flash the bootloader. After the successful flashing, tested GPIO, SPI, TIM, IIC and other on-chip peripherals, and all of them can be used normally.
